Spent a few hours exploring NixOS in a VM. The declarative system configuration is compelling -- your entire OS defined in a single file. But the learning curve is steep. The Nix language is its own thing and the documentation is scattered.

For now I'll stick with Arch for daily use but might use Nix for CI/CD pipelines where reproducibility matters more than ease of configuration.
