Finished "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann. Best technical book I've read in a while. The chapter on distributed systems consensus was exactly what I needed for understanding the CAP theorem beyond the surface level.

Started "The Art of Statistics" for the MIT MicroMasters prep. Lighter read but good foundations.

Also picked up "Flash Boys" by Michael Lewis. Good context for the algorithmic trading project -- understanding market microstructure from a narrative perspective.
