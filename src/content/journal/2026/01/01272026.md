I woke up went to work, did some integration work and finished 2 projects for the client. Workday work is quite boring but I'm getting through it. Hannah worked from home today so that was awesome. I want to become a better developer and less reliant on other people but I feel like workday is so expansive it is so hard not to lean on other people, I just don't want to feel like a burden. Anyway, I learned about Multi Doc Transfer today. I am excited to start using orchestrate more at work. 

Hannah made Cinammon Rolls that were amazing, a little too much cream cheese and my stomach hurts a little but that's alright. 

It's time to finish Unit 1 homework.
