My friend Peter made Steaks for his birthday. It was a great dinner with steak, potatos, asparagus, and frescas. We watched nobody 2 with Bob Odenkirk. The movie was so bad, like actually a 1/5. It was so silly and I feel like this movie has been made thousands of times. 

I gifted Peter a 7" monitor for Homelab monitoring.
