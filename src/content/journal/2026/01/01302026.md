My Friend Kenneth and a couple other friends hosted a pho night and made sweets and we watched whiplash. Whiplash was great, it's like my 5th time seeing it and the movie and catching up with friends was also fantastic.

Everytime I watch Whiplash I always self reflect about the pursuit of greatness and what one is willing to sacrifice in that pursuit. I want to be great and successful and live a fulfilling life, but I am unsure what needs to be sacrificed / what I should do and focus on. I want to be passionate like I used to.
