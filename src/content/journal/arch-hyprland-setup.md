Switched my main workstation to Arch with Hyprland. The Wayland compositor is fast and the tiling workflow is exactly what I wanted. Keybinds are fully customized -- Super+Enter for terminal, Super+D for app launcher, workspaces for each project.

Dotfiles are in a git repo now. Can replicate this setup on any machine in about 20 minutes.
