Launched the 3D interactive version of the portfolio site using Spline. The room scene loads in about 2 seconds on desktop, which is acceptable. Mobile fallback uses the traditional layout.

Added the trading bot dashboard and homelab status pages. The custom SVG charts turned out well -- no need for a charting library when you just need line charts and gauges.
