Practice exam for the probability module. The continuous distribution problems are straightforward if you remember to set up the integral bounds correctly. Conditional expectation via the tower property is the most useful technique -- it simplifies almost every multi-step problem.

Scored 87% on the practice. Real exam is next week. Going to review the Markov chain section one more time since the stationary distribution calculations tripped me up.
