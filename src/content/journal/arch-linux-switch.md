Finally made the jump from Ubuntu to Arch on my main workstation. Spent a Saturday afternoon going through the install wiki. The pacman package manager is genuinely faster than apt.

Hyprland as a window manager is incredible once you get the keybinds configured. Tiling WMs make so much more sense for development work. Already have my dotfiles version controlled so I can replicate the setup on other machines.

Next step is getting my Neovim config dialed in. Currently using LazyVim as a base but want to understand every plugin I'm running.
